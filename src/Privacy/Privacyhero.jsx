          as sending out newsletters or surveys or serve us services as a
          telecom operator. We may share your information with these third
          parties for those limited purposes only and with your necessary

          </strong>{" "}
          <br /> We may disclose your Information (including your Personal
          Information) to a third party if (a) we believe that disclosure is
          reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation,
          legal process or governmental request, (b) to enforce our agreements,
          policies and terms of service, (c) to protect the security or

          good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing
          the death or serious bodily injury of any person. However, nothing in
          this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or
          objections that you may have to a third party's, including a
          government's, request to disclose your information. Dove Soft Limited
          also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable

          we have received your information, we will take appropriate technical

          we protect its transmission through the use of encryption such as the
          Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. <br />

          <strong> 6. International transfers of your personal data</strong>{" "}
          <br /> In order for us to provide the Services to you, your personal
          information will be transferred to, and stored at/processed in the
          United States, Europe and Asia. Your personal data is also processed
          by staff operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA), such as
          in Asia and the USA, who work for us or for one of our suppliers. We
          will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal
          data is treated securely and in accordance with this policy. For
          transfers of personal information within the Dove Soft Limited
          corporate family, such transfer will be under the Commission's model
          contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e.,
          the standard contractual clauses), pursuant to Decision 2004/915/EC
          and 2010/87/EU. For transfers of data to third parties, such transfers

          applicable. You can contact the Data Protection Officer listed below
          to obtain a copy of the data transfer agreement or more information
          regarding the relevant safeguard we put in place. For more information

          safeguards, namely the use of standard data protection clauses adopted
          or approved by the European Commission, a copy of which can be
