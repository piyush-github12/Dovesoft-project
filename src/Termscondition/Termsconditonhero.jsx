        <b>Fair Usage Policy (FUP)</b>
        We strive to provide the best-in-class services to our customers with
        relentless dedication. There are some scenarios wherein the credits
        added in the user accounts are not utilized for a very long time, or the
        account is not used for a very long time. This non-utilization creates
        an imbalance for the other users as non-operational accounts have to be
        handled on the backend, equally consuming time and causing work
        constraints. As there are very minimal validity impositions on SMS
        services, we intend to build a fair usage scheme to ensure adequate
        utilization of credits within a reasonable time frame (6 months – 1
        year). Thus, to ensure that the services remain smooth for all our
        customers, we are introducing a Fair Usage Policy with the intention of
        service betterment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>FUPs for SMS and Voice</b>
        <br />
        The credits in the user account shall no longer remain valid, followed
        by account deactivation and approved sender id and template de-listings
        if the criteria fall in any of the following scenarios:
        <br />
        <br />
        a. If there is no account usage for six consecutive months and the User
        has not logged into his account for the last three months.
        <br />
        <br />
        b. If there has been account usage in the last six months, but the User
        has not logged into the account for the past 3 months, the account will
        be kept on hold for deactivation as per the policy (ref. a).
        <br />
        <br />
        c. If there has been no usage of the accounts in the past six months,
        but the User has logged into his account in the last three months, then
        the account will be kept on hold for deactivation as per the policy
        (ref. a).
        <br />
        <br />
        d. Under no circumstances shall there be a refund for credits used
        against respective telecom regulations. The User is expected to maintain
        regulations compliant usage of SMS credits throughout the account
        tenure.
        <br />
        <br />
        e. The User is expected to have a minimum of 10% usage of credits within
        the first month from the date of credit addition to the user account.
        <br />
        <br />
        f. The User is expected to have a minimum of 50 % usage of credits
        within the first two months from the date of credit addition to the user
        account.
        <br />
        <br />
        g. The effective credit balance on the voice platform shall be forfeited
        in case the account validity of the User has lapsed. The users are
        expected to utilize their balance within the validity period or to get
        their validity extended for the same.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Scope</b>
        <br />
        The User is entitled to use the services in context with cloud
        communications for business purposes, providing Inbound and outbound

        <br />
        <b>Payment</b>
        <br />
        The User shall be on agreeable terms with any forms of electronic
        payment modes available with Dove Soft Limited for service payments
